# Delmy-Elias-Portfolio

This project is to showcase my previous work. Potential employers can see an easy to read profile listing some information about me, seeing previous projects, and finally having my contact information.

I built this project to develop an easy to ready profile for future employers. The profile is also a first step in building responsive websites. My motivation was to put what I have learned for far to the test .

This is my first project. I will be updating this portfolio with other projects done in and out of bootcamp. This gives me an idea on how a website needs to be planned and executed .

I learn about building and organizing both my HTML and CSS . The project was quite challenging, however I am excited to have my first profile and I am more excited to continue to build it as I gain more knowledge
